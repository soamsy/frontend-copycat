                There <i>have</i> been complaints, especially by industry
                professionals. However, you'd be hard pressed to find a major
                review site that actually makes note of the errors in Persona
                5. And indeed, some people have said that the translation is
                fine, or even extremely good.

            <p class="mb-6">
                So what gives?
            </p>
            <p class="mb-6">
                This is actually a chronic pattern for media translated from
                Japanese into English. Here's an abridged explanation of why
                that is:
            </p>
            <p class="mb-6 font-bold relative">

                Japanese media is relatively niche, and started out even more so.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-6">
                For a long time, the only reason fans were able to consume
                Japanese media was due to the dedicated efforts of fan
                translators. The modern economic viability of Japanese media in
                the West is largely rooted in their efforts to bring Japanese
                content into other languages. <span class="relative text-xs bottom-2">1</span>
            </p>
            <p class="mb-6">
                Fan translators rarely have professional experience or an
                expert understanding of Japanese, and fans were tolerant of
                mistakes. The following are hallmarks of the era:
            </p>
            <ul class="mb-6 ml-5 px-6">
                <li class="p-bullet-red">Literal, word-by-word translations</li>
                <li class="p-bullet-red">Stilted writing that mimics Japanese sentence structure</li>
                <li class="p-bullet-red">Stock translations of common phrases</li>
                <li class="p-bullet-red">Leaving Japanese words untranslated even when they have English equivalents</li>
                <li class="p-bullet-red">Translation errors</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="mb-6 font-bold relative">
                <span class="absolute px-1 rotate-[-3deg] font-extrabold bg-persona-red text-black left-[-2.7rem]">#2:</span>
                Early official translations couldn't be trusted.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-6">
                If fan translations were often flawed, official translations
                were often downright incomprehensible. <span class="relative
                text-xs bottom-2">2</span> But that wasn't the root of the
                problem. The root was this:
            </p>
            <p class="mb-6">
                The official translations sometimes... sounded good.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-6">
                But while they sounded good, they were also often censored,
                altered to be more “friendly” in the West, or even completely
                rewritten.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-6">
                A new belief was born within a significant segment of the fan
                base: translations that sounded good could not be trusted. Only
                fan translations were guaranteed to be faithful to the original
                creation—that they were often stilted and contained
                untranslated content was proof of this authenticity. And
                importantly: it was proof that could be identified without
                knowing Japanese.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-6">
                All it took was a glance and anyone could tell.

                Japanese translation has a global audience.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-6">
                If English-native fans felt starved for content translated into
                their native language, fans whose first language wasn't English
                were even more so. Many ended up consuming English translations
                in order to experience Japanese media in a language they had at
                least some knowledge in—and this still happens.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-6">
                Skill levels vary, but speakers of English as a second language
                are understandably less likely to identify awkward English
                writing. In fact, flawed translations are often a blessing: the
                awkward wording, limited vocabulary, and stock lines that
                appeared in fan translations makes the content much easier to
                understand for some non-native speakers.

                Video games are more than just text.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-6">
                This one's pretty simple: if a game is fun enough, it can
                distract from weak writing. When translated games are dubbed,
                talented voice actors are also able to supply intonation to
                awkward lines that makes them seem less so. However, this
                greatly limits how good their performance can be and results in
                an inferior dub.

            <p class="mb-6">
                The result of the above factors (and more) is that complaints
                about awkward, literal translation are often countered with
                accusations of wanting to remove all references to Japanese
                culture.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-6">
                In Persona 5's case, there's one more factor: people are pretty
                upset by Atlus's streaming restrictions. Understandably, this
                has drawn attention away from the poor quality of the
                translation.

                And it should not be underestimated just how much work this
                was, especially for video games. The translators have to get
                the translation into the game somehow, and Japanese programming
                practices are famously infuriating to deal with.

                which comes from the 1992 translation of Zero Wing.
