                Unfortunately, there's no way to know for sure without Atlus
                telling us themselves or one of the translation staff coming
                forward anonymously. However, there are some hints at what the
                underlying reasons may have been.

                The translation team was massive.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-6">
                Yu Namba of Atlus has stated that Persona 5 “boasted the most
                number of translators and editors on a team”. <span
                class="relative text-xs bottom-2">1</span> That sounds
                impressive, but it rings instant alarm bells for anyone in the
                localization industry: it's like marketing your hit novel as being
                “written by the greatest number of authors.”
            </p>
            <p class="mb-6">
                And Namba's claim checks out: Persona 5's credits list a
                whopping six translators and eight editors as having worked on
                the project's localization.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-6">
                Those eight editors are especially alarming: their job is to
                unify the translation, and that's hard enough under normal
                circumstances. But with more editors than translators, they're
                actually liable to worsen the stylistic inconsistencies.

                The release was delayed for localization reasons.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-6">
                In November 2016 Atlus released a statement announcing that it
                would be pushing back the release of Persona 5 from February to
                April 2017:
                <blockquote class="mx-10 my-6 pl-8 pr-2 border-l-2 text-base">
                    <p class="mb-6">
                        “[T]he Japanese release of Persona 5 smashed all our
                        expectations, and as a company, we decided that we owed
                        our fans the very best effort to make Persona 5 our
                        gold standard in localization.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “Practically, this means redoubling our QA and
                        localization efforts, even returning to the studio to
                        record previously unvoiced lines. We don’t want to rush
                        this game and in this case, it meant we needed to move
                        the release back for the last time.”
                    </p>
                </blockquote>
                Of special note is the mention that they would be "returning"
                to the studio. This implies that they had already finished
                recording voiced lines back in November 2016, which necessarily
                required those lines to have been translated and edited by that
                point in time.

                Even voiced lines contain outright errors.

            <p class="mb-6">
                Normally, a script will be adjusted during recording to better
                reflect character voice and fix lingering mistakes. Not so with
                Persona 5.

                Now, it's difficult to say exactly what happened. Perhaps there were unreasonable time constraints. Perhaps the localization team was underqualified. Perhaps Atlus had internal issues between its American and Japanese branches—it's not unheard of for international teams to cooperate poorly, and that often hurts localization efforts. Perhaps it was all of these.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-6">
                However, there's one thing we know for sure: this was 100% avoidable, and would have been avoided had the parties in charge cared enough. The developer always has full control over the work.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-6">
                In short, whoever was responsible simply thought they could get away with it.

                The use of “most number of” is indeed poor English—consider the
                oddity of “many number of” if it doesn't quite click for
                you—but we'll cut Namba some slack and blame the editors of
                Sony's blog.
