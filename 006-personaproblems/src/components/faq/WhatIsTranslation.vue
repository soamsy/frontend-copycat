                Localization is a broader process, and involves adapting
                content so it's more easily understood in different regions.
                This generally involves translation, and may involve other
                adjustments—such as converting between regional measurement
                systems or exchanging obscure pop culture references for ones
                appropriate for the target audience.<span class="relative

                bad translation.

                Localization can be a controversial term because of how video
                game translation and consumer awareness of it have evolved over
                time. Despite misconceptions to the contrary, <span

                The trick is to ensure that the reference is equally obscure
                and has the same effect both before and after, relative to the
                given audience. A common British reference might be literally
                impossible to understand for a Japanese reader, so a localizer
                will attempt to find a common ground that clicks with the
                target audience without culturally undermining the text.
