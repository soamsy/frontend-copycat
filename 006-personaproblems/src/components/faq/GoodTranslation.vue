                Translation can be a murky concept, so first I'll define a
                standard to measure against: <span class="italic font-semibold"> imagine if translation
                weren't necessary at all. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="mb-6">
                In other words, imagine that the original writer is perfectly
                fluent in both languages and writes both versions personally.
                That creation—a perfect reflection of creator intent—is the
                standard to which translators must strive.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-6">
                A good translator, accompanied by their editor and QA staff,
                gets as close to that vision as possible. By the time they're
                finished, the only flaws in their work should belong to the
                creator, not themselves. Occasionally, a translator may even
                correct minor errors that the creator did not intend to be
                present in their creation, such as typos and inconsistencies.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-6">
                By extension, adding errors is a cardinal sin and a fundamental
                failure on the part of the translation team.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-6">
                Translators must be skilled writers, ideally even more skilled
                than the creators of the works they translate—though this is
                not always possible. An excellent translator will see deeply
                into the creator's work and draw out the nuance and fine detail
                dwelling there.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-6 font-bold">
                Above all, translation is never a word-by-word conversion.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-6">
                This is one of the greatest translation myths, and one of the
                most harmful. Translators do not convert words from one
                language to another: they convert ideas. This is why it's so
                important for them to understand creator intent. A word-by-word
                translation will always be a stiff, inferior product that
                betrays the original work and its readers.
