            I haven't listed every mistake in Persona 5, or even a substantial
            fraction of them. I've also been forced to focus on the translation
            aspect of localization, which means I haven't properly addressed
            other failings such as <a class="link" href="#">bad typography, untranslated images and
            video</a>, and voiced lines that are unsubbed even when Japanese audio
            is enabled.<span class="ref">1</span> Nor have I dedicated time to the sometimes <a class="link" href="#">strange
            handling of honorifics</a>. For those aspects and more, I'll have to
            merely conclude by saying that there are few areas in which Persona
            5's localization isn't lacking.

            That I have to say that about such a great game is unfortunate.

            If this bothers you even slightly, I encourage you to <a class="link" href="#">tweet at
            Atlus</a> as well as discuss the problem with people you know. Fans
            deserve better, but publishers like Atlus will continue to produce
            sub-par localizations if nobody speaks up.

            Keeping in mind that a lack of subtitles isn't a problem only for
            people who prefer Japanese voicingâ€”anyone who has hearing loss is
            affected, regardless of their language settings. And roughly one in
            five people has hearing loss of some form.
