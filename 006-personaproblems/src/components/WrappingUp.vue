            I haven't listed every mistake in Persona 5, or even a substantial
            fraction of them. I've also been forced to focus on the translation
            aspect of localization, which means I haven't properly addressed
            other failings such as bad typography, untranslated images and
            video, and voiced lines that are unsubbed even when Japanese audio
            is enabled.1 Nor have I dedicated time to the sometimes strange
            handling of honorifics. For those aspects and more, I'll have to
            merely conclude by saying that there are few areas in which Persona
            5's localization isn't lacking.

            That I have to say that about such a great game is unfortunate.

            If this bothers you even slightly, I encourage you to tweet at
            Atlus as well as discuss the problem with people you know. Fans
            deserve better, but publishers like Atlus will continue to produce
            sub-par localizations if nobody speaks up.

            Keeping in mind that a lack of subtitles isn't a problem only for
            people who prefer Japanese voicingâ€”anyone who has hearing loss is
            affected, regardless of their language settings. And roughly one in
            five people has hearing loss of some form.
