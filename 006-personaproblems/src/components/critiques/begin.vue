            While I'm unimpressed by Persona 5's localization, my criticism is
            of the character of the work, not the character of the people
            behind it. Video game localization requires significant effort from
            many people, and it's impossible to know exactly which were
            responsible for the script's quality. <span class="relative text-xs bottom-2">1</span>

            As such, I want it to be completely clear that <strong>I do not intend my
            statements to be a personal attack on the Persona 5 localization
            team</strong>, but merely a critique of their final product. I also want to
            acknowledge that Persona 5 does contain some inspired lines, and
            those deserve credit. I very much wish that they had been the norm,
            rather than the stand-out exception.

            publishers, ultimately resulting in better games for everyone.

            The obvious accusation, that the translators were terrible, fails
            to account for who hired the translators, or how much time the
            translators were given, or whether the translators were fine but
            the editors were bad—and so on.
