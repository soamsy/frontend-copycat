            This site was created and designed by Connor Krammer. You can get
            in touch with him on <a class="link" href="#">Twitter</a> or via email at
            <a class="link" href="#">connorkrammer@gmail.com</a>. He masquerades as an editor for a living.

            Special thanks go out to <a class="link" href="#">BlackDragonHunt</a> for hacking and
            translation help, as well as to the boatload of amazing people who
            contributed examples of poor localization and helped review the
            site before it went live.
