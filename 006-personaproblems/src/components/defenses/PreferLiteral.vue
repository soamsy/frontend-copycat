                “I prefer literal translations because they're more faithful.”
            </p>
            <p class="mb-6">
                This is a pretty common view! And it seems to make a lot of
                sense. However, there's a problem with it, and it stems from
                the following commonly held belief: that translation is about
                words.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-6">
                Translation is really about ideas.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-6">
                This can be a bit confusing to anyone who hasn't thought about
                the distinction before. Words are basically convenient common
                terms for certain concepts, which people put together as
                building blocks to express larger ideas in. Languages form when
                different groups don't agree on which words correspond to which
                concepts—but those concepts themselves are universal. <span class="relative
                text-xs bottom-2">1</span>
            </p>
            <p class="mb-6">
                To phrase it another way: words are just a way for a person to
                take their ideas and pass them on to other people. If there
                were no other people in the world, there wouldn't be any need
                for words, but there would still be a need for ideas.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-6">
                So how does that factor into translation?
            </p>

            <p class="mb-6">
                The processes behind literal translation and faithful
                translation look fundamentally different. Namely, faithful
                translators need to understand the original creator's ideas and
                methodology before they can write anything, while literal
                translators will just skip to the word phase, causing a
                degradation of quality in the process.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-6">
                Poor translators worship words. Excellent translators respect
                words, but worship ideas.

                Some languages make it harder to express certain concepts than
                others do (one language might require one word where another
                language might take five), but those concepts can always be
                explained. If this weren't true, it would be impossible to
                learn another language!
