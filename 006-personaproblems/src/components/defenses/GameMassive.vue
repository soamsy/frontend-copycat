            <p class="mb-6">
            This sometimes also takes the form “You're just cherry-picking the
            bad parts.”

            This argument is reasonable to an extent: translation is difficult,
            and mistakes do happen. But those mistakes should only be on the
            order of one misplaced comma per several thousand sentences, or a
            typo every hundred thousand characters. If the mistakes are
            frequent and noticeable, then they're unacceptable.

            Consider—how would readers react if George R. R. Martin released
            his next book and every third sentence was awkward, with every
            fifth sentence containing an objective error? Writing is hard, and
            his novels are long, after all.

            <p class="mb-6">
            Yet I doubt anyone would claim those mistakes are fine.
