                “The language is a bit stiff, but everything is still accurate.”
            </p>
            <p class="mb-6">
                Unfortunately, while it's possible for a translation to be
                stiff but understandable, stiff but <em>accurate</em> translations are
                pretty much a myth.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-6">
                There are several reasons for this. The first is that writing
                ability is strongly linked to translation skill, and someone
                who produces stiff translations is therefore more likely to
                misunderstand the original text. Or they might understand the
                original, but make a mistake when conveying it in the
                destination language.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-6">
                Another reason is the fundamental nature of language. Stiff
                translations generally suffer from being overly literal, and
                overly literal translations treat every language as 1:1
                transformations of each other, as if every language can express
                the exact same concepts in the exact same way.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-6">
                It's easy to prove that language doesn't work like this.
                Consider the Japanese <em class="dazzle">ao</em>, which is a color that encompasses
                both green and blue. English has separate words for both
                colors, meaning there's no easy 1:1 conversion between Japanese
                and English. The translator will always have to take context
                into account to decide whether to translate <em class="dazzle">ao</em> as <em class="dazzle">blue</em> or
                <em class="dazzle">green</em>.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-6">
                If you're mathematically inclined, you might recognize this as
                a form of the pigeonhole principle. If you're not
                mathematically inclined, don't worry: it's barely math. The
                pigeonhole principle is just a fancy way of saying that if you
                have more items than buckets to put them in, some of the items
                will have to share a bucket. <span class="relative
                text-xs bottom-2">1</span>
            </p>
            <p class="mb-6">
                Coming across concepts that don't translate well into a
                particular language is common for translators. When this
                happens, they have to consider context and choose the option
                that best matches the original creator's intent.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-6">
                Creator intent is also the third reason that stiff translations
                cannot be accurate. An accurate translation conveys more than
                just raw information: it conveys character voice, personality,
                and the charm of the author's style. A translation's accuracy
                is judged by how similar it is to what the creator would write
                if fluent in both languages. Unless the creator intended the
                text to be stiff, producing a stiff translation is inaccurate,
                and a failure.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-6">
                Finally: while it's possible to detect overt errors, it's
                impossible to judge whether something is fully accurate just by
                the translation. Check out the first three error samples in the
                section above for a practical example of this.

                So if you have to use your hands to carry three apples across
                the room, one of your two hands is going to have to carry an
                extra apple. Similarly, translation sometimes requires you to
                take a word from a single-bucket language and put it into a
                two-bucket language, or vice versa.
