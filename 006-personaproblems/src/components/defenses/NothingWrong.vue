                At the end of the day, this is the hardest defense to address.
                At the same time, it's also the easiest.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-6">
                One reason someone might use this defense is that they
                genuinely don't see a problem, because to them those flaws
                aren't flaws. And that's valid, so long as they accept other
                people's right to believe otherwise.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-6">
                Another reason stems from the fear people have to acknowledge
                mistakes in the things they like. After all, liking something
                flawed might mean one's opinion is bad or wrong. Or maybe
                acknowledging the mistakes will ruin the enjoyment entirely.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-6">
                The default response is often defensiveness: those mistakes
                aren't serious, or they don't exist at all.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-6">
                If this instinct ever grabs you, just remember: it's entirely
                possible to enjoy translated media and still demand that
                publishers do better. Because the work deserves it, and so do
                we.
